# SortManager
Sort Manager project at Sparta Global

How to guide

This sort manager project allows you to choose either the bubble sort, merge sort or binary tree search algorithm to sort out an unordered array.

You are able to choose how big the array is, as well as the upper limit of the numbers contained in the array.

1. When you run the sort manager it will ask you how large you want the array to be, type a desired whole number and then press 'Enter'
2. Next it will ask you for the max possible number in the array, so type that number in and then press 'Enter'
3. Now you get to choose the sort method, press 1 for bubble sort, 2 for merge sort or 3 for Binary Search
4. The program will then show you the array that was generated based on the array size you gave it and the max size, and then show you the array. It will then sort it out and it will display how long it took in nanoseconds to sort out the array
5. If you would like to try sorting out the unsorted array using a different algorithm, press 1, if you would like to finish enter any other number and then press enter
6. go back to step 4

### Notes

- This does not work with negative numbers, so don't enter any.
